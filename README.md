## Concepts

- Static vs Dynamic Websites

## HTML

HyperText Markup Language: to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language), consists of elements that describe the type of content (paragraphs, links, headings, images, videos, etc.)

### Concepts

- Elements: (e.g. `<button>`, `<article>`, `<p>`, etc.)
- Attributes: (e.g. `src`, `alt`, `href`, etc.) part on an Element
- Entities: (e.g. `&copy;`) part of the content
- Semantic HTML: (e.g. `<strong>` vs `<b>`, `<em>` vs `<i>`, `<nav>` vs `<div>`)

### Good practices

- only one `<h1>` per page
- `<strong>` instead of `<b>` (html 5)
- `<em>` instead of `<i>` (html 5)
- Always add `alt` to all images, its used by search engines to know what the image is about BUT also for screen readers used by blind people. If the image is broken the alt text is shown.

## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets: to describe the visual style and presentations of the content written in HTML

### Concepts

- CSS Rule
  - Selector: e.g. `h1`
  - Declaration Block: multiple Declarations contained by curly brackets
    - Declaration or Style: e.g. `front-size: 20px;`
      - Property: e.g. `font-size`
      - Value: e.g. `20px`
- Inline CSS: using the `style` attribute in the html code

### Good practices

- Do not use Inline CSS

## Questions

- Jonas said that HTML, CSS amd JS are the languages browsers accept. Are there other languages?
